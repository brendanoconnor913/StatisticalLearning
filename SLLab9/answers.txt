d)
In eyeballing the differences between the two trees it appears that
when the data is scaled it results in a far more "balanced" tree. 
This seems to indicate by scaling the data we get a better picture
of how the various features relate and cluster since scale no 
longer distorts relationships/distances. As a result it seems that
it would be a good idea to scale all the data before performing any
hierarchical clustering so as avoid capturing differences in scale
as part of you clustering (which is something to be avoided).
